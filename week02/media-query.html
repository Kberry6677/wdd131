            <p>
                If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, 
                that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
                not; and it shall be given.

            <h2>Mormon 7:8-9</h2>
            <p>
                Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus,
                and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set 
                before you, not only in this record but also in the record 
                which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which
                record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.
                For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe
                that; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also;
                and if ye believe this ye will known concerning your fathers,
                and also the marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God
                among them.
